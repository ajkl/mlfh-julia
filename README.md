MLFH through Julia's Eyes
==========
###### Julia code for Machine Learning for Hackers book


You can read the gitbook here - [MLFH through Julia's eyes](http://ajkl.gitbooks.io/mlfh-through-julias-eyes/)

# Introduction

This is an attempt to port the amazing book [Machine Learning for Hackers](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Hackers-Drew-Conway/dp/1449303714) by [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/) and [John Myles White](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/) code to the language [Julia](http://julialang.org/)

It is inspired from the [Will It Python?](http://slendermeans.org/pages/will-it-python.html) series by [Carl J. Vogel](http://slendermeans.org/) which ported MLFH book to Python.

The initial phase when you learn any new language is full of code-googlesearch-stackoverflow-docs-code. This is an attempt to make that effort less for others who are trying to learn stats with Julia.

I am really appreciating this technique of transforming a book like MLFH into the coding language you are just starting to learn.

I am relatively new to Julia and this is just a project for me to learn as well as contribute back. Any criticism and suggestions are welcome!

IJulia notebooks for each chapter reside at [mlfh-julia](https://github.com/ajkl/mlfh-julia)
